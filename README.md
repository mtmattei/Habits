[![Uno Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Uno%20Platform-purple?logo=unoplatform)](https://platform.uno)

A simple sample application built with the **Uno Platform** showcasing a UI concept for a Habits tracker.

The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate the capabilities of Uno Platform's **[Hot Design](https://platform.uno/hot-design/)** feature. Specifically, it shows how UI elements, such as `ListViews`, can be modified in your XAML code and updated **live** in the running application without requiring a full rebuild or restart.
